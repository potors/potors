# Welcome to my little space!

<sup>Jump to [contact](#contact)</sup>

I'm a self-taught programmer who enjoy the bizarre reality of programming at the 21st century.  
My fellows spread misinformation about programming on the internet.
Nothing I can do about it, *buuut* you can hire me!
They'll ruin your codebase :smiling_imp:, i won't! :innocent:  

I've started *learning* python when me 11 yet :baby:, now me grown up kid :man:  
But I really started programming at 14 (in the covid pandemic, meaning that I had full time computer access)  
Now I'm almost 18 :older_man:, messed up with [+10 languages](#experience) and don't have a job.  

I love math and science, messing up with music related stuff, low-level programming and making people happy.  
As you may have noticed from my profile, I'm from Brazil (south), so english isn't my first language.
Yes, it's very good for my level, I've immersed myself into foreign content so much that I can even communicate verbally (cogratulations to me :wink:)

I've played with a bunch of languages so far. Procedural, object-oriented, functional and many design patterns such as MVC, MVVM, factories, adapters, builders, etc.  

Although I don't have that much of professional experience, I've built many applications: REST APIs; CLI programs; GUI interfaces (java/raylib); Web pages; Android apps...  
Motivated by my lack of knowledge, I focused into learning **how things works behind the scenes**, that changed not only the way I program, but the way I live (what a dramatic take).  
I became more minimalistic and detached. My code will be thrown in the trash anyway. *Less is better*. That kind of thing.  

I use arch linux as daily driver for almost 3 years now, every day leaning more to the console side of the force.  
Anxious for Arc's browser linux support :pray:
